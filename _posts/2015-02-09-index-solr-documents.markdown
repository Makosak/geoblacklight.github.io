### Overview

GeoBlacklight uses GeoBlacklight-Schema as a template for metadata documents indexed by Solr.

GeoBlacklight provides a rake task to index documents as fixtures for tests. We will use this rake task to index several documents as an example.

### Download fixture metadata documents

  1. Create and move to a directory for your documents

     ```sh
     $ mkdir -p spec/fixtures/solr_documents && cd spec/fixtures/solr_documents
     ```

  1. Download some metadata documents (in JSON format) to the directory

     ```sh
     $ curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mejackreed/84abc598927c43af665b/raw/geoblacklight-documents.json
     ```

  1. Move back to app root directory

     ```sh
     $ cd - # Or cd ../../../
     ```

### Index fixture metadata documents

  1. Run the GeoBlacklight fixture indexer

     ```sh
     $ rake geoblacklight:solr:seed
     ```
    
The GeoBlacklight Solr seed task, indexes metadata documents (in JSON format) stored in the `spec/fixtures/solr_documents` directory.

  1. Start the Rails server again

     ```sh
     $ rails s -b 0.0.0.0
     ```

  1. *Optional* Commit your work

     ```sh
     $ git add .
     $ git commit -m 'Adds in JSON fixtures'
     ```

As stated above, this rake task is useful for quickly indexing a small number documents in Solr (built specifically for populating Solr for testing). I would caution though in using this task for large scale indexing and commiting, as we've developed other best practices for production-scale indexing.
