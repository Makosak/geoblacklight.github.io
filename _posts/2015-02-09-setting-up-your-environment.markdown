## Setting up your environment
  - Development requirements
  - Local attendees setup VirtualBox/Vagrant

### Development requirements

GeoBlacklight has similar prerequisites to [Blacklight][blacklight]. It diverges from Blacklight requirements by using a customized Solr schema and configuration, [Geoblacklight-Schema][geoblacklightschema].

#### Software you should have installed on your development computer

  - [Ruby > 1.9.3][installruby]
  - [Rails > 4][installrails]
  - [Git][installgit]
  - Java (for local Solr server)

Local attendees of the workshop have the option of just using the pre-created environment on the provided thumb-drive. If you are not at the workshop, you can create the virtual machine for the workshop, by following [this guide]({% post_url 2016-01-23-using-packer-to-create-a-development-virtual-machine %}).

### Local attendees setup VirtualBox/Vagrant
  
Good news for local workshop participants, this is already done for you using VirtualBox and Vagrant. On the thumb-drive underneath a directory titled 'geoblacklight_workshop'. Thanks to Justin Coyne and [Data Curation Experts](http://curationexperts.com/) for this approach that is used at HydraCamps.

For those interested in what was installed on this machine and how it was created checkout [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mejackreed/727e9cd2e971ca3949a2).

 - [Vagrant for Windows](#vagrant-for-windows)

#### Vagrant Quick Tips
After you have your virtual machine up and going, you will want to stop it. Here are a few commands that will help out.

```sh
$ vagrant halt # stops the virtual machine
$ vagrant destroy # stops and deletes the virtual machine
```

#### Vagrant for OS X and Linux
  1. Install the Mac (.dmg) version of VirtualBox and Vagrant on your machine. If you are using Linux, please download and install appropriately. [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), [Vagrant Downloads](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

  1. If not already on your Desktop, copy the `geoblacklight_workshop` directory to your `~/Desktop` directory

  1. Move to your `~/Desktop/geoblacklight_workshop` directory

    ```sh
    $ cd ~/Desktop/geoblacklight_workshop
    ```

  1. Start vagrant

    ```sh
    $ vagrant up # This command creates and configures guest machines according to your Vagrantfile.
    ```

  1. SSH to the VM

    ```sh
    $ vagrant ssh # This will SSH into a running Vagrant machine and give you access to a shell.
    ```

#### Vagrant for Windows

Thanks to Zach Vowell who contributed this guide for Windows.

Note: Please install a Windows ssh client installed such as [ PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).

  1. Install the Windows (.exe) version of VirtualBox and Vagrant on your machine.

  1. If not already on your Desktop, copy the `geoblacklight_workshop` directory to your Desktop `C:\Users\[username]\Desktop` (for Windows 7)

  1. Open a [Windows Command Prompt (cmd)](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/7-ways-launch-command-prompt-windows-7-windows-8)

  1. Move to the `geoblacklight_workshop` directory on the Desktop

    ```
    C:\Users\[username]> cd Desktop\geoblacklight_workshop
    ```

  1. Start Vagrant

    ```
    C:\Users\[username]\Desktop\geoblacklight_workshop> vagrant up
    # This command creates and configures guest machines according to your Vagrantfile.
    ```

  1. Open up PuTTY

  1. SSH into the Vagrant box by entering the following parameters into the "Basic Options for Your PuTTY session" window:
    - Host Name (or IP address): 127.0.0.1
    - Port: 2222

  1. When PuTTY shell prompts for a username and password, enter "vagrant" for both. You should now see a command prompt.
