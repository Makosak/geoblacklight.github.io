NYU's GIS Librarian [Andrew Battista](https://twitter.com/rawdeal85) created a 7-part blog post series on his experience with implementing GeoBlacklight, spatial data services, and integrating with an existing repository at NYU. This series is a great read and provides a great deal of context and information not only about GeoBlacklight, but offers fresh perspectives about repositories and GIS in libraries.

You can read the series at Andrew's blog [Curation Culture](http://www.curationculture.org/archives/2213).
