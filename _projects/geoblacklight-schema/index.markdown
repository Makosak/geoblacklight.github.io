snippet: A schema developed for geospatial discovery
---
GeoBlacklight-Schema focuses on discovery use cases for patrons and analysts in a research library setting, although it is likely useful in other settings. Text search, faceted search and refinement, and spatial search and relevancy are among the primary features that the schema enables. The schema design supports a variety of discovery applications and GIS data types. We especially wanted to provide for contextual collection-oriented discovery applications as well as traditional portal applications.

The schema is documented on the [GeoBlacklight Github Wiki.](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/wiki/Metadata)

The schema is also discussed in detail in a *code4lib* journal article here: [A Metadata Schema for Geospatial Resource Discovery Use Cases](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/9710)

### GeoBlacklight Metadata Schema Workgroup
The GeoBlacklight Metadata Schema Workgroup convened during the Summer Community Sprint in 2020. The goals of the workgroup include:

1. Systematically assessing and evaluating the GeoBlacklight Schema 1.0
2. Developing a new GeoBlacklight Metadata Schema (TBD) by January 2021 that features:
	* improved interoperability with DCAT and Dublin Core based schemas
	* new fields for rights
    * new fields for item relations

Workgroup members:
* Andrew Battista
* Abigail Pennington
* Amy Work
* Diane Fritz
* Karen Majewicz (workgroup lead)
* Kimberly Durante
* Keith Jenkins
* Lena Denis
* Mara Blake
* Michelle Janowiecki
* Margaret Mering
* Susan Powell
