snippet: A schema developed for geospatial discovery
---
GeoBlacklight is built to use the OpenGeoMetadata schema, which is designed for GIS resource discovery and focuses mainly on discovery use cases. Text search, faceted search and refinement, and spatial search and relevancy are among the primary features that the schema enables.

The schema is documented on the [OpenGeoMetadata website.](https://opengeometadata.org)

The schema is also discussed in detail in a *code4lib* journal article here: [A Metadata Schema for Geospatial Resource Discovery Use Cases](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/9710)
