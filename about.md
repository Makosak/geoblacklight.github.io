GeoBlacklight is a multi-institutional, open source geospatial data discovery software application. Based on the Blacklight Project, GeoBlacklight began in 2014 and has reached its third major release in 2020. GeoBlacklight has been adopted as an interface for geospatial data discovery by over 25 academic libraries and cultural heritage institutions.

### Community Structure

**Community Coordinator:** TBA

* Provides oversight for community processes
* Facilitates community meetings and sets agendas
* Proposes priorities for biannual community software development sprint cycles
* Stages project boards for community development sprints and coordinates stand-up meetings

**Software Advisory Committee:** TBA

* Vets software codebase and pull requests to ensure contributions align with the GeoBlacklight project Technical Values
* Reviews contributions, approve pull requests, or request edits to requests when appropriate
* Ensures that contributions are accompanied with tests and align with the direction of ancillary development projects and trends

**Communications and Outreach Coordinator:** TBA

* Provides front-facing content to inform a broader community of development, news, and announcements
* Maintains and organizes GeoBlacklight's network of projects
* Solicits writing, posts, and news from others in the community to inform a larger network of stakeholders
* Propagates news about the GeoBlacklight project
* Coordinates efforts to document the project and provide learning for other adopters

**Metadata Development and Policy Committee**

* Offers oversight and direction on the development of GeoBlacklight metadata
* Investigates search and discovery technologies in Solr and keeps the community aware of these developments
* Propagates best practices for authoring, managing, and producing metadata for geospatial data discovery

### Technical Values

The aim of declaring the Technical Values is to better communicate how decisions are made for the GeoBlacklight project. We hope that this will help adopters and contributors make decisions about metadata, local customizations and changes, and enhance understanding throughout the community.

#### Overview of Values

The GeoBlacklight project’s core focus is to provide an application for successful geospatial discovery. To achieve this, we follow several technical principles. While these principles help drive technical decision making, we need to do a better job of expressing decision making processes.

* Focus on geospatial data and information discovery. Geospatial analysis tools are great, but we probably do not have the community support to create new ones. Rather than build analysis tools in GeoBlacklight, we focus on integration with existing tools.
* Geospatial discovery initially focused on discretely catalogued data objects, but has expanded over time to include a wider range of information sources.
* Prioritize stability for metadata and software. We aim to semantically version our software and metadata so that is usable for as many adopters as possible. Many GeoBlacklight adopters are in the cultural heritage space where metadata and software development resources can be limited.
* GeoBlacklight should be customizable and extensible. We want to make GeoBlacklight customizable for common use cases, and extensible to a plugin for a less common use case.
* Build community. We recognize the importance of collaboration and community. We use this to enable collaboration on software, metadata, and sharing best practices.
* We prioritize end user experience, including inclusivity and accessibility in design features whenever possible.
* Leverage existing communities. Building on open standards, and existing standards, gives us more bandwidth to focus on discovery. We also aim to use the existing systems to build plugins and extend the software.
* We have a commitment to locate and demystify power in this community, with the goal of lowering the barrier of entry for newcomers to the project.
* Training, workshops, tutorials, and documentation should be prioritized and updated as the software changes over time.


#### Measures of Success

* GeoBlacklight newcomers and long timers will have better clarity about why certain features make sense in GeoBlacklight, another gem, or in a local application
* Better understanding about the compatibility requirements for the metadata schema
* A lowering in percentage of discussions about whether a function should be a feature, a plugin or live locally.
* More qualities of what libraries and library leaders have identified as the markings of an anti-racist organization. See the National Juvenile Justice Network’s rubric.
* Any organization has methods for participating and contributing to development. See this article: Care, Code, and Digital Libraries: Embracing Critical Practice in Digital Library Communities

### Project Roadmap

GeoBlacklight has adopted a roadmap to project future development of the project. The core parts of the project development include:

* Biannual development sprints, held in the summer and January
* Forecasting of development goals
